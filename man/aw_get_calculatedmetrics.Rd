\arguments{
\item{company_id}{Company Id.  Taken from the global environment by default if not provided.}

\item{rsids}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics tied to specified RSID list (comma-delimited)}

\item{ownerId}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics owned by the specified loginId}

\item{filterByIds}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics in the specified list (comma-delimited list of IDs) (this is the same as calculatedMetricFilter, and is overwritten by calculatedMetricFilter}

\item{toBeUsedInRsid}{The report suite where the calculated metric intended to be used. This report suite will be used to determine things like compatibility and permissions. If it is not specified then the permissions will be calculated based on the union of all metrics authorized in all groups the user belongs to. If the compatibility expansion is specified and toBeUsedInRsid is not then the compatibility returned is based off the compatibility from the last time the calculated metric was saved.}

\item{locale}{Locale (en_US default)}

\item{name}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics that contains the Name}

\item{tagnames}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics that contains one of the tags}

\item{favorite}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics that are favorites (boolean)}

\item{approved}{Filter list to only include calculated metrics that are approved (boolean)}

\item{limit}{Number of results per page}

\item{page}{Page number (base 0 - first page is "0")}

\item{sortDirection}{Sort direction (ASC or DESC)}

\item{sortProperty}{Property to sort by (name, modified_date, id is currently allowed)}

\item{expansion}{Comma-delimited list of additional calculated metric metadata fields to include on response. (options = reportSuiteName, ownerFullName, modified, tags, definition, compatability, categories)}

\item{includeType}{Include additional calculated metrics not owned by user. The "all" option takes precedence over "shared" (options = all, shared, templates)}
